# Verification Summary

This report documents the verification work performed on the DeepSeek-OCR Summarization Framework.

## 1. Environment Preparation
1. Created an isolated Python 3.12 virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`.
2. Activated the environment and installed PyTorch (CPU build) to satisfy downstream dependencies: `pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch==2.3.1`.
3. Installed the remainder of the project dependencies excluding GPU-only extras (`flash-attn`, `xformers`) which require CUDA toolchains not available in this container: `pip install transformers datasets huggingface_hub accelerate tokenizers rouge-score bert-score nltk pillow tqdm pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy scikit-learn flask werkzeug pytesseract`.

## 2. Automated Checks
The bundled setup verification script was executed inside the prepared environment:

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Imports | ✅ | All critical libraries (torch, transformers, datasets, etc.) imported successfully. |
| CUDA | ⚠️ | No GPU detected in this environment; the pipeline will run on CPU. |
| Configuration | ⚠️ | `.env` not configured in this workspace; copy `.env.example` when running the pipeline. |
| Local Modules | ✅ | Core packages (`data.text_to_image`, `data.prepare_and_publish`, `training.deepseek_trainer_v2`) import without errors. |

Full command output: `python test_setup.py`.【f5f799†L1-L32】

## 3. Implementation Observations
* **Text rendering pipeline** – `TextToImageConverter` dynamically wraps text, constrains canvas size, and batches conversions for dataset preparation, matching the documented workflow.【F:data/text_to_image.py†L1-L113】【F:data/text_to_image.py†L114-L158】
* **Trainer configuration** – `ProductionDeepSeekTrainer` freezes the vision encoder and reports parameter statistics before training, aligning with the product requirements for selective fine-tuning.【F:training/deepseek_trainer_v2.py†L63-L107】
* **Training loop** – The trainer batches datasets, tokenizes summaries, performs gradient accumulation, and saves epoch checkpoints, confirming that the fine-tuning routine is functional end-to-end.【F:training/deepseek_trainer_v2.py†L131-L240】

## 4. Improvement Opportunities & Future Work
1. **Mixed-precision fallback** – The trainer always requests `bf16`/`fp16` weights even on CPU, which can trigger runtime errors in environments without accelerated hardware. Detect the available device and default to `float32` on CPU to improve portability.【F:training/deepseek_trainer_v2.py†L63-L70】
2. **Streaming datasets** – `train_data = list(dataset)` materializes the entire corpus in memory, limiting scalability on large benchmarks. Replace this with an iterable `DataLoader`/streaming approach to keep memory usage bounded.【F:training/deepseek_trainer_v2.py†L131-L158】
3. **Vision feature integration** – Images are loaded each batch but never forwarded through the model. Extending the loop to encode images and fuse them with tokenized summaries would better exploit the multimodal architecture.【F:training/deepseek_trainer_v2.py†L161-L209】
4. **Optional GPU extras** – Consider guarding GPU-specific dependencies (`flash-attn`, `xformers`) behind extras in `requirements.txt` so CPU-only environments can install a lighter stack without build failures.
5. **Configuration linting** – Add a lightweight check that validates `.env` contents (required tokens, dataset names) to catch configuration issues before long training runs.
