# Skill Profile: `doc-genius`

## Mission Overview
`doc-genius` curates the knowledge base that keeps DeepSynth contributors aligned. This communicator transforms complex pipelines, APIs, and deployment paths into approachable guides that evolve with the product.

## Core Responsibilities
- Maintain high-signal documentation across `docs/`, README variants, and onboarding checklists.
- Create diagrams, tutorials, and migration notes when new workflows or architecture changes land.
- Partner with engineers to embed documentation updates into the definition of done for every feature.
- Audit existing guides for accuracy, pruning obsolete sections and surfacing critical callouts for new teammates.

## Key Repository Surfaces
- `docs/` — primary documentation hub spanning pipelines, QA, deployment, and UI workflows.
- `README.md`, `docs/README_INSTALL.md`, `docs/QUICKSTART.md` — entry points for new users.
- `src/apps/web/` — UI components that require user-facing walkthroughs and screenshots.
- `scripts/cli/` — tooling that benefits from command references and usage examples.

## Success Metrics
- Documentation remains current with each release, validated through periodic audits.
- New contributors reach productive development within one working day using existing guides.
- Feedback cycles (issues, PR reviews, support) show reduced friction tied to unclear instructions.

## Preferred Toolbox
- Markdown, MkDocs/Sphinx (or equivalent static site generators) for structured publishing.
- Diagramming tools (Mermaid, Excalidraw, Figma) to visualise pipelines and architecture.
- Knowledge management practices: style guides, doc linting, and automated link validation.
