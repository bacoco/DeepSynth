## 🔧 Implementation Guidance for Claude

### Skill Structure
Create a Claude skill with the following structure:
```
.claude/skills/data-wizard/
├── SKILL.md (name: data-wizard, description, activation triggers)
├── FORMS.md (optional configuration options)
├── examples.md (usage examples)
├── reference.md (technical details)
└── scripts/ (if helper scripts needed)
```

### Key Activation Triggers
Claude should activate data-wizard when:
- Detecting general-related keywords and context
- User requests general assistance
- General optimization opportunities identified
- Working with general files or systems

### Recommended Behavior
The skill should:
1. **Auto-detect** general contexts without explicit user requests
2. **Suggest improvements** proactively when patterns are detected
3. **Apply best practices** automatically where safe
4. **Learn preferences** from user feedback and choices
5. **Integrate with SOUL** for session-to-session learning

### Configuration Options (FORMS.md)
Consider these user preferences:
- Automation level (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- Notification preferences (silent, informative, verbose)
- Domain-specific settings for general
- Integration with existing tools and workflows
