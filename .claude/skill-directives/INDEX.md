## How to Use Directives

1. **Review a directive** to understand the detected need
2. **Claude reads the directive** and creates appropriate skill
3. **New skill is deployed** to `.claude/skills/`
4. **Skill becomes available** immediately for use

## Directive Generation

Directives are automatically generated by NEXUS when:
- Pattern detector identifies recurring themes
- Priority score exceeds threshold
- SOUL data shows skill gap opportunities
