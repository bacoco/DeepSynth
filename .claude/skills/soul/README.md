# 🔮 SOUL - Universal AI Agent Memory System

> **S**eamless **O**rganized **U**niversal **L**earning

> **The first universal AI agent consciousness that transcends individual sessions and models**

SOUL is a revolutionary system that gives AI agents persistent memory and collaborative intelligence. Any AI agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.) can inherit the complete work history, decisions, and context from previous agents, creating true AI collaboration across models and sessions.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before this skill:**
- ❌ Each agent starts with no knowledge of previous work
- ❌ Problems get solved multiple times by different agents  
- ❌ No continuity between agent sessions
- ❌ Lost context when switching computers

**After this skill:**
- ✅ Complete work history preserved automatically
- ✅ Problems and solutions documented for future agents
- ✅ Seamless handoffs between agent sessions
- ✅ Cross-computer collaboration enabled

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Install to Claude Skills Directory
```bash
cd skills/agent-work-tracer
./install.sh
```

### Option 2: Use Directly from Repository
```bash
# Run manually when needed
python3 skills/agent-work-tracer/trace_session.py
python3 skills/agent-work-tracer/handoff_generator.py
```

## 📋 Files Created

The skill automatically creates these files:

### `.agent_log.md`
Comprehensive work log with:
- Session information and timestamps
- Files changed and categories
- Recent commits and their purposes  
- Problems solved with solutions
- Current repository state
- Recommendations for next agent

### `.agent_status.json`
Machine-readable status containing:
- Session history and statistics
- Current git state
- Files modified counts
- Structured data for other agents

### `.agent_handoff.md`
Quick handoff notes with:
- Priority next steps
- Critical context
- Recently solved problems
- Key project files
- Immediate action items

### `.agent_handoff_detailed.md`
Comprehensive handoff including:
- Full project analysis
- Technical decisions made
- User context and preferences
- Detailed action plan
- Resource references

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Activation
The skill activates when Claude detects:
- Git repository with changes
- Development work being performed
- Files being modified or created
- Technical problems being solved

### Manual Usage
```bash
# Trace current session
python3 skills/agent-work-tracer/trace_session.py --verbose

# Generate handoff notes
python3 skills/agent-work-tracer/handoff_generator.py --both

# Help
python3 skills/agent-work-tracer/trace_session.py --help
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Quick Handoff Preview
```markdown
# 🔄 Agent Handoff - 2024-10-25 12:21

## 🚀 Ready to Continue
**Project**: deepseek-synthesia
**Status**: ✅ Ready

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Run `./run_global_pipeline.sh` to continue dataset creation
2. Run `python test_setup.py` to verify environment
3. Ensure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🔧 Technical Context
- Project uses global incremental pipeline for cross-computer work
- Requires HuggingFace token configuration

## ✅ Recently Solved
- Fixed disk space management in uploader
- Implemented cross-computer resume functionality
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Individual Agents
- **Context Awareness**: Understand what previous agents accomplished
- **Efficiency**: Don't repeat solved problems
- **Continuity**: Pick up exactly where others left off

### For Development Teams
- **Collaboration**: Multiple agents can work on same project
- **Knowledge Base**: Accumulated solutions over time
- **Accountability**: Clear record of each agent's contributions

### For Users
- **Transparency**: See exactly what each agent did
- **Reliability**: Consistent progress tracking
- **Flexibility**: Switch between computers/agents seamlessly

## 🔄 Agent-to-Agent Communication

The skill enables agents to communicate through persistent files:

```
Agent A (Session 1)
    ↓ creates
.agent_log.md + .agent_status.json
    ↓ read by
Agent B (Session 2)  
    ↓ updates
.agent_log.md + .agent_status.json
    ↓ read by
Agent C (Different Computer)
```

## 🛠️ Customization

### Configuration File
Create `.agent_tracer_config.json`:
```json
{
  "log_level": "detailed",
  "include_file_diffs": false,
  "max_log_entries": 50,
  "auto_commit_logs": true
}
```

### Template Customization
Edit `log_template.md` to change the format of generated logs.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Test the skill
cd skills/agent-work-tracer
python3 trace_session.py --repo . --verbose
python3 handoff_generator.py --repo . --both

# Verify files created
ls -la ../../.agent_*
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating
- Ensure files are in `~/.claude/skills/agent-work-tracer/`
- Check that scripts are executable: `chmod +x *.py`
- Verify Claude has Code Execution Tool enabled

### Missing Git Information
- Ensure you're in a git repository
- Check git is installed and accessible
- Verify repository has commits

### Permission Issues
```bash
chmod +x skills/agent-work-tracer/*.py
chmod +x skills/agent-work-tracer/install.sh
```
